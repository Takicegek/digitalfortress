As per your directions, I was successful in breaking the PDP11 of Nikomozi Raustelia. All her files were crypto-graphed by some ace professional. Although it was hard, I managed to decipher it.
One interesting information I found out about Nikomozi is that she lives by two names. Her official name, as in front of the public is Izomokin Ailetsuar. Hence, I suggest that all her public view finding should now be carried with this name. Tracking her location is tough, but she keeps a set patterned algorithm saved in her drive from which we can determine her location instantly
I apologise of being out of schedule. This job was not like the others ones.
I will be coming to Italy this 15th. Along with her 512KB magnetised disk which contains all her information.
Meet you there.
47.

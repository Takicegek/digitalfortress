This is RMS, Richard Stallman. He is popularly called as the Hacker's God.
No, he is not into the type of hacking that you are doing. His Hacking is what 
hacking actually is. He develops opensource softwares. He is from MIT's AI Lab.
He launched the project called GNU which is recursive acronym for GNU is Not Unix.
RMS started this project as soon as he quit the AI Lab. The project was started at 1983.
He wrote few pieces of information such as the its policy (free policy) and few source code
in 1983.
The project was partialy sucessfully but it is not yet complete. The kernel is still not fully written.
The reason is unknown, but few say that as Linux drove in, RMS lost his interest in GNU's Kernel.
When asked the reason, all he sends is this image of his with a note ``if you are smart enough, you will find out.
If you aren't, you don't need to."
So, we are not smart enough, perhaps you are.

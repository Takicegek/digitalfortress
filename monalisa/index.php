        Last month, 18 of the emails of Nizab-ul-quadar ( A terrorist group ) were intercepted by our security experts. The first few email discussed about planting of a<img src="img/monalisa.bmp" height="200" width="200" align="left">
Nuclear Bomb somewhere in the world. The eighteenth mail were supposed to carry the information about where this bomb has been planted. But to our surprise we only received, this image as the email. Our expert say that this was the only thing they found. I have given a re-interception request to the headquarters but we don't have much time left. I suspect that there is some meaning associated with this image. Unfortunately I am not able to find that out. So I just thought perhaps you could do something about it. Please, do this as soon as possible. This is of highest priority. If we are able to find out the location of the bomb before hand, I think we have a very good change to defuse it before it blows.
Millions of life are in your hand. Please do something.
Please tell us the location.
